<p>This is a series of video lectures to teach programmers and software engineers how
to write their own TLA+ specifications.  It assumes a basic understanding of
programming concepts.  Some knowledge of elementary mathematics, such as might be
taught in a beginning university math course for computer scientists, would also be helpful.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>Steel is an embeddable scheme interpreter, with a standalone cli included as well. Inspired largely by Racket, the language seeks to be ergonomic scheme variant helpful for embedding in applications, or to be used on its own with high performance functions implemented in Rust. The language implementation itself contains a fairly powerful macro system based on the syntax-rules style and a bytecode virtual machine. At the moment, it is not explicitly compliant with any individual scheme specification.</p>

<p>RacoGrad is a simple deep learning library implemented in Racket, a version of scheme-lisp, designed to provide a basic framework for building and training feedforward neural networks. The library includes essential components such as tensor operations, activation functions, loss functions, and backpropagation for gradient calculation and weight updates. This is a hobby project, with updates coming sporadically.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I first heard of core.logic three or four months ago, and I’ve been trying to learn more about it ever since. It’s apparently an implementation of miniKanren in Clojure, where miniKanren is a small language implemented in Scheme that’s a stripped-down version of a system called KANREN.
Long story short, core.logic is a library that lets you do logic programming in Clojure.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>The promise of logic programming is that programs can be written relationally,
without distinguishing between input and output arguments. Relational programs
are remarkably flexible—for example, a relational type-inferencer also performs type
checking and type inhabitation, while a relational theorem prover generates theo-
rems as well as proofs and can even be used as a simple proof assistant.
Unfortunately, writing relational programs is difficult, and requires many inter-
esting and unusual tools and techniques. For example, a relational interpreter for
a subset of Scheme might use nominal unification to support variable binding and
scope, Constraint Logic Programming over Finite Domains (CLP(FD)) to imple-
ment relational arithmetic, and tabling to improve termination behavior.
In this dissertation I present miniKanren, a family of languages specifically de-
signed for relational programming, and which supports a variety of relational idioms
and techniques. I show how miniKanren can be used to write interesting relational
programs, including an extremely flexible lean tableau theorem prover and a novel
constraint-free binary arithmetic system with strong termination guarantees. I also
present interesting and practical techniques used to implement miniKanren, includ-
ing a nominal unifier that uses triangular rather than idempotent substitutions and
a novel “walk”-based algorithm for variable lookup in triangular substitutions.
The result of this research is a family of languages that supports a variety of
relational idioms and techniques, making it feasible and useful to write interesting
programs as relations.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>&ldquo;I’ve been experimenting with lisps for about 6 month now, clojure, common lisp, emacs lisp, and a little racket. I recently finished my biggest code so far, solving all the Protohackers challenges in Common Lisp, so I thought I’d share my thoughts. I also contributed a little to “real software” with bug fixes and small features in projects but for the most part I don’t have any real experience yet, this is just my first impressions, not the words of someone experienced in these languages. The TLDR is: don’t be scared off by the parenthesis, and don’t assume languages are better because they’re more “modern”. If you’re tired of discussion of old topics (parenthesis, editors, languages), then skip ahead to the protohackers section for dissection of some tricky concurrency bugs.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>CPS, or continuation-passing style, is an intermediate representation for programs, particularly functional programs. It’s used in compilers for languages such as SML and Scheme.  Much of its utility comes from its support for tail calls and nonlocal control flow such as call/cc, but it can also be used as an optimization target just as SSA, or static single assignment, often is.</p>
<p>In CPS, there are two rules: first, that function/operator arguments must always be trivial; second, that function calls do not return. From this, a lot falls out.</p>

<h3 id="abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p>MIT 6.5940 Fall 2024 course focuses on efficient machine learning and systems. This is a crucial area as deep neural networks demand extraordinary levels of computation, hindering its deployment on everyday devices and burdening the cloud infrastructure. This course introduces efficient AI computing techniques that enable powerful deep learning applications on resource-constrained devices. Topics include model compression, pruning, quantization, neural architecture search, distributed training, data/model parallelism, gradient compression, and on-device fine-tuning. It also introduces application-specific acceleration techniques for large language models and diffusion models. Students will get hands-on experience implementing model compression techniques and deploying large language models (Llama2-7B) on a laptop.</p>
