## [TLA+ Video Course](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html)

### Abstract

This is a series of video lectures to teach programmers and software engineers how 
to write their own TLA+ specifications.  It assumes a basic understanding of 
programming concepts.  Some knowledge of elementary mathematics, such as might be 
taught in a beginning university math course for computer scientists, would also be helpful.
