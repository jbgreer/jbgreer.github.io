## Dimity Jones in Puzzle Castle

[Dimity Jones in Puzzle Castle](https://obnakwa.itch.io/dimityjones) is in the form of a single
text file, of which only the first chapter is readable. Subsequent chapters must be deciphered by
you, using the answers to puzzles that you must solve!

With eighty-nine conundrums to crack and ciphers to decode, this 110,000-word novel is unlike any
other, offering dozens of hours of delight, befuddlement, and heart-pounding adventure to readers
of all ages who love puzzles, programming, and poetry ... or at least poet-villains.
