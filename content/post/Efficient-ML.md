## TinyML and Efficient Deep Learning  Computing

### MIT 6.5940 Fall 2024

[This](https://efficientml.ai) course focuses on efficient machine
learning and systems. This is a crucial area as deep neural networks demand extraordinary levels
of computation, hindering its deployment on everyday devices and burdening the cloud
infrastructure. This course introduces efficient AI computing techniques that enable powerful deep
learning applications on resource-constrained devices. Topics include model compression, pruning,
quantization, neural architecture search, distributed training, data/model parallelism, gradient
compression, and on-device fine-tuning. It also introduces application-specific acceleration
techniques for large language models and diffusion models. Students will get hands-on experience
implementing model compression techniques and deploying large language models (Llama2-7B) on a
laptop.
