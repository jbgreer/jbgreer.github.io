## [Explorations in Clojure's Core Logic](https://jrheard.tumblr.com/post/43575891007/explorations-in-clojures-corelogic)

### Abstract

"I first heard of core.logic three or four months ago, and I’ve been trying to learn more about it ever since. It’s apparently an implementation of miniKanren in Clojure, where miniKanren is a small language implemented in Scheme that’s a stripped-down version of a system called KANREN.
Long story short, core.logic is a library that lets you do logic programming in Clojure."
