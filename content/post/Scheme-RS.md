## [Scheme-RS: a scheme implementation in (async) Rust](https://maplant.com/2025-02-17-Why-I'm-Writing-a-Scheme-Implementation-in-2025-(The-Answer-is-Async-Rust).html)

### Abstract

Scheme-rs is a work-in-progress implementation of R6RS that allows for seamless interoperability with async Rust. All you have to do is add scheme-rs to your Cargo.toml, define some bridge functions with the provided proc macros, and scheme-rs will provide you with a way to dynamically glue your code together, including allowing you to provide a REPL for debugging, inspecting, or even orchestrating your system.
