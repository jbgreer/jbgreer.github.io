## [Hazel live functional programming language](https://hazel.org)We are first implementing these ideas into Hazel, a web-based programming environment for an Elm/ML-like functional programming language designed around typed-hole-driven development.

Uniquely, every incomplete program that you can construct using Hazel's language of edit actions is both statically and dynamically well-defined, i.e. it has a (possibly incomplete) type, and you can run it to produce a (possibly incomplete) result. Consequently, Hazel serves as an elegant platform for research on the future of programming (and programming education).
