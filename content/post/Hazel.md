## (Hazel live functional programming language)[https://hazel.org]

### Abstract

Hazel is a live functional programming environment that is able to typecheck, manipulate, and even run incomplete programs, i.e. programs with holes. There are no meaningless editor states.

We are first implementing these ideas into Hazel, a web-based programming environment for an Elm/ML-like functional programming language designed around typed-hole-driven development.

Uniquely, every incomplete program that you can construct using Hazel's language of edit actions is both statically and dynamically well-defined, i.e. it has a (possibly incomplete) type, and you can run it to produce a (possibly incomplete) result. Consequently, Hazel serves as an elegant platform for research on the future of programming (and programming education).
